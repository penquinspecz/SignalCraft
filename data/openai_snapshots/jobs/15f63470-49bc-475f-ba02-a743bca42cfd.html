  <meta name="description" content="About the team

The Technical Success team is responsible for ensuring the safe and effective deployment of ChatGPT and OpenAI API applications. We act as a trusted advisor and thought leader for our customers, ensuring developers and enterprises maximize value from our models and products.

About the role

We are seeking a Sales Engineering leader to own and elevate technical aspects of OpenAI’s sales motion. This role is responsible for ensuring customers realize maximum value, impact, and adoption from our models and platforms. You&#39;re a deeply technical, customer-obsessed leader who represents the voice of the customer and unifies our customer-facing technical teams around a cohesive, world-class experience across the entire customer lifecycle.

This role is critical to the success of our go-to-market strategy and will have a meaningful influence on both the direction of our technology in the market and how organizations adopt it. You will oversee technical aspects of the sales process, spanning pre-sales solution design and technical validation. You&#39;ll also partner closely with post-sales teams as needed to ensure continuity, trust, and long-term success for our customers.

You will lead and develop a high-performing team of Solutions Engineers who rely on your leadership to deliver exceptional technical expertise, credibility, and customer outcomes. This role works in close partnership with Sales, Solutions Architecture (post-sales), Customer Success, Security, and Product, and reports directly to the Head of Technical Success, APAC.

This role is based in our Sydney office. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:

 - Help craft and continuously refine the strategic vision for OpenAI&#39;s Solutions Engineering function, aligning it with broader company objectives and the evolving needs of our diverse clientele.

 - Lead and mentor a multifaceted team through the entire sales cycle, fostering an environment that promotes seamless customer engagement, maximum adoption, and scalability.

 - Collaborate with cross-functional teams including GTM, Product, Engineering, and Research, ensuring synergy and cohesion in our customer engagement strategies.

 - Act as the escalation technical contact for key clients in your sales segment, building trust and a direct line of communication with executive-level stakeholders.

 - Be a thought leader in the industry, advocating for the effective and innovative application of our AI technologies across various sectors.

 - Champion a customer-first approach within the organization, inspiring your team to always prioritize client satisfaction and success.

You’ll thrive in this role if you:

 - Possess deep technical acumen, particularly in AI and related platform technologies, enabling you to engage effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders alike.

 - Are experienced in developing and executing large-scale technical success strategies.

 - Excel in motivating and steering a high-performing team, fostering both individual and collective excellence.

 - Have experience leading teams spanning across multiple APAC markets and geographies.

 - Can distill complex technical concepts into clear, comprehensible communication, adaptable to diverse audiences.

 - Embody a customer-centric philosophy, motivating your team to embrace this ethos.

 - Demonstrate outstanding presentation and communication skills, particularly when interacting with executive-level individuals.

 - Approach your work with humility, a collaborative spirit, and a continuous learning mindset.

 - Are adept at problem-solving, prioritizing effectively under pressure.

 - Are deeply committed to the ethical and safe advancement of AI technology.
