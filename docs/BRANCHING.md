# Branch Lifecycle Policy

## Default

- **Short-lived feature branches only.** Create a branch for a PR; merge; done.
- **After merge:** Head branches are **auto-deleted** (repo setting `delete_branch_on_merge`).
- Do not use permanent branch names.

## Exceptions

None for now. Revisit when introducing marketing/product release workflows.
