## What this proves

1. Terraform apply evidence is captured with real operator transcripts:
- `provision_terraform_apply.log` (failed attempt showing invalid 1.33 -> 1.29 downgrade request)
- `provision_terraform_apply_reconcile.log` (successful reconcile apply with `Apply complete!`)
- `terraform_evidence.log` (includes apply transcript plus terraform output/state evidence)

2. ECR pull evidence is captured for the proof job pod:
- `kubectl_describe_pod.log` shows `Image`, `Image ID`, and `Events` with `Reason=Pulled`.
- `kubectl_get_events.log` shows `Pulled` event and image reference for the same pod.

## Notes

- These receipts are generated by `scripts/ops/capture_m3_infra_receipts.py --execute`.
- Logs were scanned with `ji_engine.utils.redaction.scan_text_for_secrets`; no secret-like patterns were found.
