    <title>Strategy &amp; Operations Manager, Support @ OpenAI</title><meta name="title" content="Strategy &amp; Operations Manager, Support @ OpenAI" />
    
  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

The User Operations team (Support) is central to ensuring that our customers&#39; experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI&#39;s customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises.

About the Role

We are seeking a senior strategy and operations leader to build, lead, and scale the Strategy &amp; Operations function within OpenAI’s User Operations organization. In this role, you will manage a high-impact team of strategy and operations practitioners while owning the service strategy, planning, and execution mechanisms that underpin our customer support operations.

You will be accountable for how User Operations scales – designing and evolving our support model, forecasting and planning for growth, and ensuring we have the right capacity, capabilities, and operating rhythm to meet user needs as OpenAI’s products and footprint expand rapidly. This role acts as the connective tissue between strategy, planning, and execution, and as a force multiplier for User Operations leadership.

You’ll be responsible for deeply understanding our existing support strategy and operating model, quickly gaining context on where we are and where we’re going – and then running with it, pressure-testing it, and evolving it as needed. This is not a role focused on documenting or maintaining playbooks. AI has fundamentally changed the customer experience and the nature of support operations; this role requires a leader who can define future-state service models, anticipate second- and third-order impacts of scale, and continuously adapt our operating approach.

In this role, you will:

 - Lead and develop the Strategy &amp; Operations team within User Operations, setting clear direction, priorities, and quality bars, while raising the operational and strategic maturity of the org.

 - Own Service Strategy for User Operations, including support model design, tiering and entitlements, and the evolution of our end-to-end customer experience.

 - Own forecasting and capacity planning for User Operations, partnering closely with Finance and Data teams to translate demand signals into headcount, vendor strategy, tooling investments, and operating plans.

 - Serve as a strategic partner to User Operations leadership, helping define long-term direction while ensuring near-term priorities are executed against with rigor and accountability.

 - Drive AI-native operations across User Operations, embedding LLMs and automation into service strategy, workforce models, tooling, and decision-making. Technology is not an adjunct here – it is foundational to how we design support.

 - Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Data leaders to identify and solve the most critical scaling challenges in support, including deflection strategy, self-service expansion, tooling evolution, and operational quality.

 - Bring structure to ambiguity and momentum to execution, establishing program structure, decision frameworks, and operating rhythms that allow teams to move quickly without losing coherence.

 - Lead deep, analytical dives into the core drivers of support performance, including volume, handle time, backlog, SLA risk, cost-to-serve, automation efficacy, and customer experience signals.

 - Own change management for major operational shifts, ensuring new strategies, service models, and systems are adopted effectively across internal teams and external partners.

 - Act as a senior escalation and alignment point across the org, connecting strategy, planning, and execution, and ensuring leadership has clarity into progress, risks, and tradeoffs.

You might thrive in this role if you:

 - Have 10+ years of work experience in customer support operations and/or a strategy &amp; ops function, with deep, hands-on experience running and scaling support organizations, and prior people-management responsibility.

 - Bring a strong, opinionated point of view on customer support operations, including service strategy, workforce planning, automation strategy, and operating cadence – and can quickly adapt that perspective to OpenAI’s unique context.

 - Have led forecasting, capacity planning, and annual planning in complex, high-growth environments, with comfort operating under significant uncertainty and imperfect data.

 - Operate comfortably at all altitudes, from executive-level strategy conversations to detailed discussions on queue dynamics, SLAs, routing logic, and agent performance.

 - Have a proven track record of owning large, ambiguous problem spaces end-to-end, translating them into clear priorities, executable plans, and measurable outcomes.

 - Have a deep passion for AI, technology, and customer experience, and are energized by the opportunity to redefine how customer support operates at a global scale.

In this role, you will manage a high-impact team of strategy and operations practitioners while owning the service strategy, planning, and execution mechanisms that underpin our customer support operations.\n\nYou will be accountable for how User Operations scales – designing and evolving our support model, forecasting and planning for growth, and ensuring we have the right capacity, capabilities, and operating rhythm to meet user needs as OpenAI’s products and footprint expand rapidly. This role acts as the connective tissue between strategy, planning, and execution, and as a force multiplier for User Operations leadership.\n\nYou’ll be responsible for deeply understanding our existing support strategy and operating model, quickly gaining context on where we are and where we’re going – and then running with it, pressure-testing it, and evolving it as needed. This is not a role focused on documenting or maintaining playbooks. AI has fundamentally changed the customer experience and the nature of support operations; this role requires a leader who can define future-state service models, anticipate second- and third-order impacts of scale, and continuously adapt our operating approach.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Lead and develop the Strategy & Operations team within User Operations, setting clear direction, priorities, and quality bars, while raising the operational and strategic maturity of the org.\n\n - Own Service Strategy for User Operations, including support model design, tiering and entitlements, and the evolution of our end-to-end customer experience.\n\n - Own forecasting and capacity planning for User Operations, partnering closely with Finance and Data teams to translate demand signals into headcount, vendor strategy, tooling investments, and operating plans.\n\n - Serve as a strategic partner to User Operations leadership, helping define long-term direction while ensuring near-term priorities are executed against with rigor and accountability.\n\n - Drive AI-native operations across User Operations, embedding LLMs and automation into service strategy, workforce models, tooling, and decision-making. Technology is not an adjunct here – it is foundational to how we design support.\n\n - Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and Data leaders to identify and solve the most critical scaling challenges in support, including deflection strategy, self-service expansion, tooling evolution, and operational quality.\n\n - Bring structure to ambiguity and momentum to execution, establishing program structure, decision frameworks, and operating rhythms that allow teams to move quickly without losing coherence.\n\n - Lead deep, analytical dives into the core drivers of support performance, including volume, handle time, backlog, SLA risk, cost-to-serve, automation efficacy, and customer experience signals.\n\n - Own change management for major operational shifts, ensuring new strategies, service models, and systems are adopted effectively across internal teams and external partners.\n\n - Act as a senior escalation and alignment point across the org, connecting strategy, planning, and execution, and ensuring leadership has clarity into progress, risks, and tradeoffs.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have 10+ years of work experience in customer support operations and/or a strategy & ops function, with deep, hands-on experience running and scaling support organizations, and prior people-management responsibility.\n\n - Bring a strong, opinionated point of view on customer support operations, including service strategy, workforce planning, automation strategy, and operating cadence – and can quickly adapt that perspective to OpenAI’s unique context.\n\n - Have led forecasting, capacity planning, and annual planning in complex, high-growth environments, with comfort operating under significant uncertainty and imperfect data.\n\n - Operate comfortably at all altitudes, from executive-level strategy conversations to detailed discussions on queue dynamics, SLAs, routing logic, and agent performance.\n\n - Have a proven track record of owning large, ambiguous problem spaces end-to-end, translating them into clear priorities, executable plans, and measurable outcomes.\n\n - Have a deep passion for AI, technology, and customer experience, and are energized by the opportunity to redefine how customer support operates at a global scale."},"descriptionClosing":{"html":"<p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\"><strong>About OpenAI</strong></p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
