  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

Security is at the foundation of OpenAI’s mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.  

The Security team protects OpenAI’s technology, people, and products. We are technical in what we build but are operational in how we do our work, and are committed to supporting all products and research at OpenAI. Our Security team tenets include: prioritizing for impact, enabling researchers, preparing for future transformative technologies, and engaging a robust security culture.  

About the Role

As a Security Engineer you will join our OpenAI engineers and researchers in building, operating and securing transformational AI technologies. This role will focus on all aspects of Detection &amp; Response, including infrastructure and operations, and will also contribute to the Security team as a strong generalist. In this role, you will:

 - Drive projects in all major security verticals including: AppSec, InfraSec, OffSec and Detection and Response

 - Innovate to solve novel security problems 

 - Collaborate on cutting-edge AI research, and use AI to improve OpenAI’s Security posture 

This role may be based in Sydney, Australia, Tokyo, Japan or Singapore. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:

 - Innovate on Detection and Response infrastructure. 

 - Build tools for managing the lifecycle of detection rules.

 - Develop, measure, and tune detection rules to ensure effective and sustainable operations.

 - Automate manual response processes. 

 - Ensure visibility and control of OpenAI’s endpoint fleet (macOS, Windows).

 - Driving improvements across identity access and management (IAM), device management, productivity software, and our use of public cloud environments (e.g. AWS, Microsoft Azure).

You might thrive in this role if you: 

 - Experience in Security or a Security-adjacent field.

 - Experience with Microsoft Azure and/or cloud infrastructure platforms.

 - Knowledge of modern adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.

 - Proficiency with a scripting language (e.g. Python, Bash, PowerShell, or similar).

 - Ability to empathize and collaborate with colleagues, independently manage and run projects, and prioritize efforts for risk reduction.
