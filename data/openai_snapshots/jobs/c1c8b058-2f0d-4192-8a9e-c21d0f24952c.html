    <title>Software Engineer, Codex for Teams @ OpenAI</title><meta name="title" content="Software Engineer, Codex for Teams @ OpenAI" />
    
  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

With Codex we’re building an AI software engineer. One that you can pair with, delegate to, or even ask to take on future tasks proactively. Our team is a fast-moving group within OpenAI, bringing together research, engineering, design, and product. We iteratively build the Codex agent harness and product to get the most out of the model, and we iteratively train the model to be great at complex software engineering tasks.

The Codex team is responsible for building state-of-the-art AI systems that can write code, reason about software, and act as intelligent agents for developers and non-developers alike. We operate across research, engineering, product, and infrastructure; owning the full lifecycle of experimentation, deployment, and iteration on novel coding capabilities.

Codex for Teams builds products and platform capabilities to drive the adoption of Codex in diverse team environments. It is a cross-cutting team that works across the stack to build both delightful product experiences and fundamental platform capabilities. Its customers range from small teams to large enterprises, and our mission is critical to achieving the vision of Codex as a proactive teammate.

About the Role

This role is for a software engineer working on Codex, with a specific focus on enabling team-scale adoption across a wide spectrum of environments, from internal teams at OpenAI to external customers ranging from startups to large enterprises. You’ll work directly with customers, Go To Market (GTM) teams, and other engineers and researchers across Codex and OpenAI. You will turn diverse team requirements into products that scale across organizations. The role bridges what teams with Codex’s capabilities, ensuring that they are robust, repeatable, and deeply aligned with how developers work in real-world environments. You’ll own systems end-to-end (architecture, implementation, production operations) with a strong bias for both quality and velocity.

In this role, you will:

 - Ship fundamental capabilities including analytics dashboards and APIs, compliance and audit surfaces, workspace RBAC and admin controls, managed configuration and constraints, and rate limits, usage, and pricing primitives for teams.

 - Design and build robust, full-stack services and APIs that power Codex across surfaces (web/app, CLI/local, IDEs, CI/CD) with strong observability, reliability, and security.

 - Enable standardized team deployments by building team configuration packaging and distribution patterns that make it easy to roll out consistent experiences across workspaces.

 - Integrate with enterprise identity and governance systems (e.g., SSO/SAML/OIDC, SCIM, RBAC, policy enforcement), and build data-access patterns that are secure, performant, and compliant for large customers.

 - Partner with GTM to work hands-on with teams through deep engagements to accelerate adoption, iterate rapidly, and translate real-world feedback into scalable product and platform improvements.

You might thrive in this role if you:

 - Have strong software engineering fundamentals and experience turning ideas into productionized systems, thinking holistically about speed, performance, and user experience.

 - Are proficient in one or more backend languages (e.g., Python, Go, Rust) and distributed systems concepts, with a focus on reliability, observability, and security.

 - Enjoy building cross-cutting platform capabilities that unlock product velocity, and you’re comfortable working across services, APIs, and end-user product surfaces.

 - Have experience with team/enterprise foundations such as identity and access (SAML/OIDC), SCIM, RBAC, audit/compliance logging, policy enforcement, and data governance controls.

 - Have built developer tools and workflows (CLI/IDE/SDK), automation systems (triggers/scheduling), or integration platforms that connect products to a broader ecosystem of tools.

 - Like working directly with users/customers (or alongside GTM/solutions teams), and can translate messy, diverse requirements into opinionated implementations that scale across many teams.

 - Enjoy 0 -&gt; 1 environments, can navigate ambiguity, and bring crisp product thinking to technical trade-offs.
