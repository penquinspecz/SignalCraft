# Provenance Always Enforced Receipt (2026-02-22)

## Labels (Before/After)

All three provenance labels already existed:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| from-composer | PRs generated by Composer workflow/tooling |
| from-codex | PRs authored/executed directly by Codex |
| from-human | PRs authored by humans (not Composer/Codex) |

No new labels created.

## Workflow Enforcement

`.github/workflows/pr-governance.yml` already enforces:

- **Exactly one** provenance label (`from-composer`, `from-codex`, or `from-human`)
- Title must NOT contain `[from-composer]`, `[from-codex]`, or `[from-human]`

Relevant code (unchanged):

```javascript
const PROVENANCE = ['from-composer', 'from-codex', 'from-human'];
const provenanceLabels = labels.filter(l => PROVENANCE.includes(l));
if (provenanceLabels.length !== 1) {
  errors.push(`PROVENANCE: Expected exactly 1 provenance label; found ${provenanceLabels.length}...`);
}
```

## Doc Updates

- **docs/LABELS.md:** Clarified "every PR must have exactly one provenance label; pick based on who authored"; added from-codex example
- **docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md:** Same clarification; added "How to label quickly" snippet
- **.github/pull_request_template.md:** Updated provenance section to cover all three labels
