The AI Adoption &amp; Deployment team ensures the successful post-sales deployment and value realization of ChatGPT Enterprise and other OpenAI products for customers across industries. AI Adoption Managers collaborate closely with Sales, Technical Success, and Product teams to deliver exceptional AI experiences and measurable business results. Our customers include large enterprises, startups, and digital native organizations. As an AI Adoption Manager, you’ll help companies transform their business by adopting solutions that make use of our newest, most exciting models.

About the role

We are looking for an AI Adoption Manager to collaborate directly with our largest Enterprise and Strategic customers. You are crucial to the success of our largest customers and will be instrumental in driving adoption and value of our products, ultimately responsible for understanding our customer’s needs and delivering an excellent experience. You will collaborate closely with the Sales, Product, Marketing, Partnerships, and Engineering teams.

The ideal candidate for this role will have a successful track record of managing and growing Fortune 500 customers, delivering strategic advice, and driving AI adoption. You must understand the motivation, business drivers, strategic goals and desired business outcomes for your portfolio of large enterprise customers.  You will lead a cross-functional partnership across your named customer(s) and identify new ways our platform can differentiate them in the market.

This role is based in Tokyo, Japan. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

In this role, you will:

 - Work with enterprise and strategic organizations to bring our products to the biggest global organizations.

 - Create and implement AI adoption plans that outline goals, potential challenges, KPIs, and timelines.

 - Travel ~15% of the time, to develop and nurture strong customer relationships to understand their business goals and needs.

 - Strategize and execute initiatives to deliver an exceptional customer experience.

 - Own the relationship with Product for these largest customers who are pushing the product’s boundaries. 

 - Work with our Partnerships team on our partner strategy and model with third parties and system integrators.

 - Be an AI thought leader with customers and pair this with deep industry specific expertise to help drive this transformative technology. Work as an internal leader to share and scale those insights and frameworks to the CS team.

 - Implement and run use case development and enablement sessions that can scale across multiple regions and lines of business.

 - Gather and relay customer feedback to internal stakeholders, and identify themes across customers to incorporate into product planning.

 - Collaborate closely with the Sales team to ensure seamless handoff between pre- and post-sale.

 - Anticipate at-risk renewals or user churn and collaborate with the relevant internal teams to devise corrective action plans.

 - Foster customer advocacy and facilitate customer testimonials and case studies.

You’ll thrive in this role if you:

 - Have 8+ years of experience in a customer success (or similar) role, preferably working with a technical enterprise product.

 - Are proficient in both Japanese and English, as this is essential to effectively carry out key responsibilities such as partnering with customers and product teams, developing use cases, demonstrating value, and collaborating with headquarters.

 - Have 5+ years managing relationships with large, global, and complex organizations.

 - Experience working with global 1000 Enterprise customers with multiple stakeholders, and managing adoption programs as the key advisor to global as well as regional customer organizations. 

 - Highly skilled at building deep and broad relationships across a complex, matrixed organization.

 - Possess exceptional presentation and communication skills, particularly when engaging with executives and leaders.

 - Can proactively identify pain points in the product and with our customers.

 - Have a humble attitude, an eagerness to help others, and a desire to pick up whatever knowledge you&#39;re missing to make both your team and our customers succeed.

 - Operate with high horsepower, have strong problem-solving skills, are adept at frequent context switching, effectively manage working on multiple projects at once with expansive ownership, and ruthlessly prioritize.

 - Are personally committed to fostering the safe and ethical evolution of AI.
