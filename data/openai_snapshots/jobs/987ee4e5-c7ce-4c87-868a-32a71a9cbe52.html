  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We believe that achieving our goal requires effective engagement with public policy stakeholders and the broader community impacted by AI. Accordingly, our Global Affairs team builds authentic, collaborative relationships with public officials and the broader AI policymaking community to inform and support our shared work in these domains. We ensure that insights from policymakers inform our work and – in collaboration with our colleagues and external stakeholders – seek to shape policy so that it aligns with and supports our mission.

About the Role

This position reports to OpenAI’s global Head of National Security Policy and will help to advance OpenAI’s engagement with Europe’s national security community and shape our approach to the dynamic European policy and military landscape. This is a senior IC role at the heart of EU/NATO policy engagement. You will be OpenAI’s primary policy representative on matters related to defense, security, and AI policy across Europe, positioning OpenAI as a trusted partner for national security stakeholders in NATO, the European Union, and national governments.

Key responsibilities include:

 - Building and sustaining strong relationships with key European decision-makers across NATO, the EU, and national ministries of defense, intelligence services, and cybersecurity agencies.

 - Representing OpenAI in high-level discussions with European national security officials, lawmakers, and multilateral bodies.

 - Leading engagements with European think tanks, research institutions, industry associations, and multilateral working groups focused on AI and security.

 - Coordinating closely with the Europe regional team, and acting as a cross-functional connector across OpenAI’s global policy team to align between European efforts and broader national security strategy.

 - Monitoring and influencing developments in European defense, intelligence, dual-use technologies, and export controls relevant to AI, including identifying relevant funding opportunities to support business growth.

 - Drafting policy briefs, strategy memos, and responses to inquiries from European governments and institutions on national security and public safety implications of advanced AI systems.

 - Collaborating closely with and advising internal OpenAI teams to identify opportunities to strengthen European resilience and advance beneficial uses of AI for democratic defense.

The preferred location for this role is Brussels, with other major European capitals considered by exception, and will require regular travel throughout Europe and occasional trips to the United States. We offer relocation assistance to new employees.

You should thrive in this role if you:

 - Are politically astute, with a deep understanding of NATO and EU security architecture, and the defense and intelligence apparatus of major European democracies.

 - Are an experienced relationship builder with an established network of senior government officials, multilateral institutions, and/or civil society stakeholders in a national security or technology policy context.

 - Possess outstanding communication and diplomatic skills, with the ability to represent OpenAI externally and work effectively across cultures.

We&#39;re looking for a blend of:

 - 10+ years of experience in European or transatlantic security, including within NATO, the EU, or national ministries of defense or intelligence. Candidates with prior industry and government relations experience will have an advantage.

 - Demonstrated credibility with senior stakeholders across the European national security ecosystem.

 - Multi-lingual candidates (English plus another European language) a significant plus.

 - Familiarity with emerging technology issues, particularly dual-use AI capabilities, including CBRN and cybersecurity.

 - Strong strategic instincts and the ability to deliver results in a fast-paced, evolving environment.
