## PR #212 status

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | fix(ops): use python3 in dr_restore for M19 DR flow |
| State | CLOSED (closedAt: 2026-02-22T02:23:55Z) |
| Base | main |
| Head | codex/m19-dr-restore-python3 |
| Files changed | scripts/ops/dr_restore.sh (+3, -2) |

## Superseded proof

- **PR #212 change:** Switch contract JSON parsing in `dr_restore.sh` from `jq` to `python3` (fail-fast on systems without `jq`).
- **main (c9bf2b3):** `scripts/ops/dr_restore.sh` already uses `PY_BIN` (default `python3`) for contract parsing at lines 96–97:
  - `bucket="$(echo "${contract_json}" | "${PY_BIN}" -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["bucket"])')"`
  - `keys="$(echo "${contract_json}" | "${PY_BIN}" -c 'import json,sys; print("\n".join(json.load(sys.stdin)["required_keys"]))')"`
- **Superseding PRs:** #213 (M19 DR merge prep), #214 (cost discipline + validate-only skip mode) brought the orchestrator flow and python3-based `dr_restore.sh` to main.
- **Conclusion:** PR #212 is superseded; its changes are on main via later PRs.

## Actions taken

1. Added PR comment: "Superseded by #213 (M19 DR merge prep) and #214 (cost discipline + validate-only skip mode). The python3-based contract JSON parsing in dr_restore.sh is now on main via the orchestrator flow. Closing. [from-composer]"
2. PR #212 was already closed; no close action needed.
3. Deleted remote branch `codex/m19-dr-restore-python3`.
4. Ran `git fetch --prune` to remove stale local refs.

## Result

- PR #212: closed with superseded comment.
- Branch `codex/m19-dr-restore-python3`: deleted from origin.
- Repo has fewer dangling branches than before.
