    <title>Growth Paid Marketing Platform Engineer  @ OpenAI</title><meta name="title" content="Growth Paid Marketing Platform Engineer  @ OpenAI" />
    
  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

The ChatGPT team works across research, engineering, product, and design to bring OpenAI’s technology to the world.

We seek to learn from deployment and broadly distribute the benefits of AI, while ensuring that this powerful tool is used responsibly and safely. We aim to make our innovative tools globally accessible, transcending geographic, economic, or platform barriers. Our commitment is to facilitate the use of AI to enhance lives, fostered by rigorous insights into how people use our products.


About the Role

We are looking for an experienced fullstack engineer to join our new ChatGPT Growth team to build and scale the systems that power OpenAI’s marketing channels and spend efficiency. Your role will include projects such as developing campaign management tools, integrating with major ad platforms, building real-time attribution and reporting pipelines, and enabling experimentation frameworks to optimize our objectives. As we are in the early stages of building this platform, we will rely on you to design and implement foundational MarTech infrastructure that make our marketing investments more effective, measurable, and automated. We value engineers who are impact-driven, autonomous, and adept at turning ambiguous business goals into robust technical systems.


In this role, you will:

 - Drive long-term growth of ChatGPT by building the technical infrastructure behind OpenAI’s paid marketing platform.

 - Design and deploy backend APIs, data pipelines and services to support campaign management, attribution, and spend optimization.

 - Execute on projects by working closely with growth marketing, data science, product, and other engineering teams to land impact on growth goals.

 - Create a diverse and inclusive culture that makes all feel welcome while enabling radical candor and the challenging of group-think.

You might thrive in this role if you:

 - Are comfortable with ambiguity and rapidly changing conditions. You view changes as an opportunity to add structure and order when necessary.

 - Have shipped systems that power marketing or growth use cases, such as attribution pipelines, campaign management tools, or integrations with major ad platforms.

 - Are highly analytical and have experience designing and implementing A/B tests, with a scientific approach to data-based experiments. You know exactly what and how to track business metrics and KPIs.

 - Have a voracious and intrinsic desire to learn and fill in missing skills. An equally strong talent for sharing that information clearly and concisely with others.

 - Are comfortable with ambiguity and rapidly changing conditions. You view changes as an opportunity to add structure and order when necessary.
