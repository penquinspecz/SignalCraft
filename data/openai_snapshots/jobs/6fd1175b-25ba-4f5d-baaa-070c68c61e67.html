  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

The GTM International team helps bring OpenAI’s products and impact to markets around the world, partnering with leaders, customers, and communities to accelerate responsible AI adoption. In this role, you’ll support our regional MD and APAC GTM leader to drive clarity, alignment, and momentum across time zones and fast-moving priorities. You’ll navigate complex international environments, build connective tissue between APAC and HQ, and support leaders operating at global scale. If you love building structure in high-growth environments, thrive in multicultural settings, and enjoy partnering closely with ambitious teams to unlock impact, you’ll feel right at home here.

Our Executive Business Partners serve as trusted advisors and collaborators to OpenAI&#39;s executives and leaders, focused on strong communication and operational excellence across teams. With a focus on elevating the impact and efficiency of leadership, we anticipate needs, streamline processes, and provide comprehensive support to ensure our executives can focus on high-impact initiatives. We play a pivotal role in driving success and achieving key milestones by cultivating strong relationships and leveraging our deep understanding of business objectives. With a commitment to excellence and a proactive approach, we are dedicated to empowering our executives and contributing to the overall growth and success of the company.

Our leadership team reflects OpenAI’s culture and core values and is a mission-driven, kind, and thoughtful group. We take pride in creating a work environment that fosters collaboration, open communication, and authenticity, making OpenAI an excellent place to work for highly accomplished professionals.

About the Role

The Executive Business Partner will be a proactive and adaptable partner to executives, managing complex scheduling, coordinating projects, and optimizing workflows. This role requires independence, task-level ownership, and a deep understanding of OpenAI’s mission to foster AGI that benefits humanity. The ideal candidate is comfortable with ambiguity, rapidly-evolving business priorities, and can drive best practices to help scale exec and team operations.

This role is based in Singapore. We follow a hybrid work model of three days in the office each week.

In this role, you will:

 - Build strong connections within the immediate team and across other departments, becoming a trusted partner to leaders. This includes an understanding of team dynamics, priorities, and stakeholders, facilitating seamless coordination on high-stakes projects

 - Excel in sharing information clearly and efficiently, adapting communication styles for a broad range of audiences

 - Balance the calendars and priorities of multiple leaders, demonstrating prioritization skills and agility in adapting to shifts in priorities, while maintaining accuracy and meeting deadlines

 - Operate with discretion and independence, proactively optimizing processes and flagging risks, while ensuring sensitive information is handled with care

You might thrive in this role if you:

 - 5+ years experience in a cross-functional executive assistant role or similar support function.

 - Successfully supported multiple leaders in the past.

 - Worked in a hard tech startup or similar environment.

 - Experience working across APAC markets and collaborating with U.S.-based HQ teams.

 - High cross-cultural EQ and ability to tailor communication styles for diverse stakeholders.

 - Strong operational rigor — able to run cadences, track priorities, and maintain alignment across time zones.

 - Comfortable supporting complex, rapid travel across international regions.

 - Strong communication - being able to tailor a message appropriate to a specific audience (writing an email to a Senator vs. a Customer vs. an Exec)

 - Discretion - this role will have exposure to sensitive knowledge so must be rock solid on confidentiality

 - Humility/diplomacy - this role has the potential to accrue power in a unique ways, but we want this person to be decisive and make noncontroversial decisions

 - Very fluent in Google Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Gmail, etc. and other modern productivity software, and are excited to learn and use new tools.

 - Genuine interest in the technology we’re building and the transformative potential of AI
