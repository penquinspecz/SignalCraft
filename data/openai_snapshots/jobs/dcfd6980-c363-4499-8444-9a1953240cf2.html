  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

The Growth team drives user and revenue growth across ChatGPT’s consumer and business segments worldwide. We operate across the full funnel - from awareness and acquisition through activation, retention, and expansion - using a combination of global performance marketing, AI-powered workflows, in-product optimization, insights, experimentation, and creative ops engineering.

Our Product Growth (PG) team is a rapidly scaling functional area, accelerating growth by connecting out-of-product and in-product experiences into seamless journeys that acquire, retain, and re-engage users, unlocking ChatGPT’s transformative potential in users’ daily lives. We work cross-functionally with product, engineering, design, data science, finance, and marketing to unlock scalable growth levers and deliver measurable impact across diverse markets.

This team thrives on rapid testing, rigorous measurement, and creative problem solving, all while keeping user value at the center of our decision-making.

About the Role

We are seeking a full-funnel growth athlete with deep expertise in product growth, growth marketing, creative-led social channels, India consumer behavior, funnel optimization, and sophisticated experimentation. You will own growth initiatives end-to-end from ideation and deployment to measurement and iteration tuned to the region’s mobile and social dynamics.

This role requires strong cross-functional collaboration with engineering, data science, design, and product to scale highly localized growth levers. You’ll focus on scaling paid acquisition efficiently across high-impact channels, improving conversion across mobile and app funnels, driving new business adoption, and building infrastructure to maximize ROI while expanding India-specific channels, segments, and workflows.

This role is based in India. Travel as needed for key cross-functional sprints and regional collaboration.

In this role, you will:

 - Design, launch, and optimize global paid and organic acquisition campaigns across channels (search, social, referral, influencer, programmatic), balancing efforts across B2B and B2C segments.

 - Leading growth experiments and A/B testing across funnels and entry points - defining hypotheses, setting up measurement frameworks, enhancing conversions, and translating insights into scalable playbooks.

 - Partnering with engineering and data science to build, test, and refine growth tooling, creative ops automation, and optimization algorithms.

 - Managing full-funnel performance metrics, from CPM/CPC to LTV/CAC, and identifying new opportunities for efficiency and scale.

 - Developing AI-native workflows that transform how we scale, reach, personalize bringing users from out-of-product experiences to in-product entry points and LTV-optimized user journeys.

 - Build AI-first creative systems, collaborating with design to rapidly prototype and test high-performing assets.

 - Expanding growth channels and market coverage, with attention to localization and regional performance nuances.

 - Driving influencer and creator partnerships as part of the paid and organic growth mix.

 - Collaborating with product teams to improve in-product conversion and onboarding flows.

 - Developing and refining our attribution models, marketing tech stack, and automation processes to ensure we’re always optimizing for maximum impact.

You might thrive in this role if you:

 - 8+ years of experience in growth optimizations, growth marketing, performance marketing, or product growth, or product strategy and operations experience, ideally in hyper-growth tech companies.

 - Proven ability to launch, scale, and optimize paid channels.

 - Strong analytical skills and proficiency with measurement and funnel optimizations. (BI, SQL, experimentation, statistically rigorous testing, conversion optimizations).

 - Experience with AI-driven marketing tools, creative ops engineering, and workflow automation.

 - Familiarity with engineering concepts and ability to work with technical teams to ship growth and martech infrastructure.

 - A test-and-learn mindset and comfort with fast-paced, ambiguous environments.

 - Excellent cross-functional communication skills and stakeholder management experience.
