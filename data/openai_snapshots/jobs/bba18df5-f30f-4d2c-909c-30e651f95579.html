  <meta name="description" content="About the team
The Frontier Evals &amp; Environments team builds north star model environments to drive progress towards safe AGI/ASI. This team builds ambitious environments to measure and steer our models, and creates self-improvement loops to steer our training, safety, and launch decisions. Some of the team&#39;s open-sourced evaluations include GDPval https://openai.com/index/gdpval/, SWE-bench Verified https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/, MLE-bench https://openai.com/index/mle-bench/, PaperBench https://openai.com/index/paperbench/, and SWE-Lancer https://openai.com/index/swe-lancer/, and the team built and ran frontier evaluations for GPT4o https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4o-system-card.pdf, o1 https://openai.com/index/openai-o1-system-card/, o3 https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/2221c875-02dc-4789-800b-e7758f3722c1/o3-and-o4-mini-system-card.pdf, GPT 4.5 https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card-2272025.pdf, ChatGPT Agent https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/, and GPT5 https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-system-card/. If you are interested in feeling firsthand the fast progress of our models, and steering them towards good, this is the team for you.


About you
We seek exceptional research engineers that can push the boundaries of our frontier models. Specifically, we are looking for those that will help us shape our empirical grasp of the whole spectrum of AI capabilities measurement and will own individual threads within this endeavor end-to-end.


In this role, you&#39;ll:

 - Create ambitious RL environments to push our models to their limits

 - Work on measuring frontier model capabilities, skills, and behaviors

 - Develop new methodologies for automatically exploring the behavior of these models

 - Help steer training for our largest training runs, and see the future first

 - Design scalable systems and processes to support continuous evaluation

 - Build self-improvement loops to automate model understanding

We expect you to be:

 - Passionate and knowledgeable about AGI/ASI measurement

 - Strong engineering and statistical analysis skills

 - Able to think outside the box and have a robust “red-teaming mindset”

 - Experienced in ML research engineering, stochastic systems, observability and monitoring, LLM-enabled applications, and/or another technical domain applicable to AI evaluations

 - Able to operate effectively in a dynamic and extremely fast-paced research environment as well as scope and deliver projects end-to-end

It would be great if you also have:

 - First-hand experience in red-teaming systems—be it computer systems or otherwise

 - An ability to work cross-functionally

 - Excellent communication skills

About OpenAI

OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. 

We are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.
