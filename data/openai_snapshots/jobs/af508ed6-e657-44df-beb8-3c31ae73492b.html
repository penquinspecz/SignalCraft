 - Identify and implement process improvements and automation opportunities to increase efficiency, accuracy, and coverage.

 - Conduct quality reviews and provide feedback to improve consistency across global teams.

 - Analyze trends and generate insights from escalation and case data to inform policy, product, model behavior, or detection improvements.

 - Maintain exceptional accuracy, judgment, and composure under pressure when handling sensitive or time-critical situations.

 - Participate in 24/7 on-call rotation, including off-hours and weekend coverage as needed.


YOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU:

 - Have 5+ years of experience in trust &amp; safety, content moderation, investigations, fraud, or developer risk operations.

 - Thrive in ambiguous, high-autonomy environments and balance speed with diligence.

 - Are comfortable with frequent context switching, managing multiple projects, and prioritizing impact.
