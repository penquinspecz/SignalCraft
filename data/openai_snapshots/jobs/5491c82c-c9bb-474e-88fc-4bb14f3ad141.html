  <meta name="description" content="About the team

OpenAI’s Forward Deployed Engineering team partners with customers to turn research breakthroughs into production systems. We operate at the intersection of customer delivery and core platform development.

About the role
As a foundational FDE manager, you’ll lead FDE through high-stakes, ambiguous customer deployments and own technical and business value outcomes end to end. You’ll grow a team that can operate under pressure and help OpenAI learn from the field.

You’ll partner closely with Product, Research, Sales, and GTM to ensure fieldwork informs roadmap priorities, drives new exploration, and supports safe deployment at scale. Your decisions will influence how OpenAI is trusted by the customers closest to our deployment work. Your success will be measured by how consistently your team ships, how clearly you deliver signal to Research and Product, and how durable your team and delivery model prove to be.

This role is based in Singapore. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees. This role also will require travel up to 25%.

In this role you will

 - Lead and grow a team of FDE delivering production systems with frontier models

 - Own end-to-end delivery outcomes through clarity, speed, tight coordination, and technical quality

 - Codify what works into tools, playbooks, and roadmap inputs that create leverage for both OpenAI and our wider developer community

 - Notice early indicators and raise them with urgency, whether in product behavior, customer environments, or delivery practices

 - Use judgement to distinguish what requires action and what does not

 - Set a high bar for FDE performance and support each person’s growth through direct, actionable feedback

 - Define how we staff and support field teams that can scale without added complexity

You might thrive in this role if you

 - Bring 8+ years of engineering or technical delivery experience, including 2+ years managing high-performing FDE or customer-facing engineers

 - Have led high-pressure technical projects from prototype to production

 - Write and review production-grade code across frontend and backend using Javascript or Python

 - Simplify complex work and make fast, sound decisions under pressure

 - Elevate team performance through clarity, not process

 - Operate with urgency in ambiguous or evolving environments

 - Translate field experience into sharp, actionable feedback for Product and Research

 - Build deep trust with your team by modeling calm, focus, and judgment when it matters most
