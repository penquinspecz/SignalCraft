  <meta name="description" content="ABOUT THE TEAM

The GTM Partnerships team is responsible for building a best in class, partner ecosystem in ASEAN region that makes our customers successful, supports the company&#39;s mission of reaching AGI, and impacts the revenue growth of the company.


ABOUT THE ROLE

We are hiring a partner director to operationalize, activate, and manage strategic partner relationships in ASEAN countries - owning the journey from contract signature to full-scale execution. This role will own all aspects of the partner lifecycle, from selecting the appropriate potential partners, assessing their alignment with our requirements, onboarding newly signed partners, driving enablement, coordinating joint solution development, and ensuring commercial activation. You will be the connective tissue between OpenAI and the partner’s delivery, technical, and sales organizations to ensure the partnership delivers results.

Reporting to the APAC Partnerships Lead, this role will be based in Singapore. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week.


IN THIS ROLE YOU WILL:

 - Own the day-to-day relationship with all signed services partners in ASEAN countries, acting as the single point of contact across enablement, solutioning, and GTM execution.

 - Drive and manage onboarding across workstreams including sales training, technical enablement, security and provisioning, and support operations.

 - Ensure partner readiness to deploy and resell OpenAI solutions, through shared project plans, milestone tracking, and joint QBRs.

 - Orchestrate co-developed solutions by collaborating with partners to define use cases, create demo assets, and localize technical documentation.

 - Monitor partner performance, flag risks early, and drive structured remediation or acceleration plans as needed.

 - Coordinate across OpenAI teams including Sales, Solution Engineering, Enablement, Operations, Customer Success, and Marketing to ensure partner needs are met and internal alignment is maintained.

 - Establish operational rhythms such as roadmap briefings, asset distribution, and sales enablement refreshes.

 - Ensure compliance with partnership agreements, including commercial terms, dedicated personnel commitments, and reporting cadences.


YOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU HAVE:

 - 7+ years of experience in alliances, partner success, or sales in enterprise software or systems integration environments.

 - Deep experience in partner onboarding and activation, ideally with hyperscale cloud or enterprise SaaS vendor, boutique consulting firms, large regional SIs and technology consultants.

 - Strong program management skills with the ability to track multiple workstreams and hold cross-functional stakeholders accountable.

 - Familiarity with the regional enterprise ecosystem and an ability to manage relationships across both local and global partner teams.

 - Experience working at the early stage at a high growth company, where programs are in their infancy and the partner motion is building.

 - Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, high-growth, and collaborative environment.

 - Excellent communication and interpersonal skills—can influence without authority and drive urgency with empathy.
