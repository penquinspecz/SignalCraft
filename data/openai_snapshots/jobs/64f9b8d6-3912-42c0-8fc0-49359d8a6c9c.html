  <meta name="description" content="About the Team

We are a small and fast-moving partnerships team that shapes and executes OpenAI’s most strategic collaborations in India. We work at the intersection of product, growth, and market expansion to build impactful relationships that accelerate adoption and unlock new use cases for OpenAI’s technologies. The team partners closely with product, engineering, research, marketing, finance, legal, and operations to design and deliver partnerships that scale OpenAI’s presence and relevance across diverse markets.

Our focus is on establishing long-term strategic partners and driving sustainable growth through integrated, high-impact product experiences across consumer and B2B offerings in the region.

About the Role

As India Product Partnerships Lead, you will lead and scale strategic partnerships primarily in India. You will be responsible for initiating, structuring, and growing partnerships that expand OpenAI’s distribution, deepen user engagement, and accelerate product adoption across the region.

This role requires strong commercial judgment, regional market fluency, and the ability to work closely with product teams to translate strategic opportunities into scalable partnership models. You will operate at both strategic and execution levels — shaping partnership strategy while driving concrete outcomes that contribute to OpenAI’s growth.

This role is based in Bangalore or New Delhi.

You’ll be responsible for:

 - Initiating and scaling strategic partnerships in India that drive user growth, distribution, and adoption for OpenAI’s consumer and B2B offerings.

 - Establishing and managing long-term strategic partners in India, serving as the primary relationship owner and strategic lead.

 - Identifying and executing market-specific growth opportunities such as bundled offerings, embedded distribution, platform integrations, and co-developed product experiences.

 - Shaping joint product strategy with partners by aligning roadmaps, defining shared priorities, and unlocking new use cases tailored to regional needs.

 - Structuring, negotiating, and managing complex partnership agreements from inception through launch and scale, ensuring commercial and strategic alignment.

 - Creating and operating governance models with partners through regular strategic reviews, executive syncs, and performance check-ins.

 - Defining success metrics and tracking impact across growth, adoption, engagement, and partner performance, communicating results to senior leadership.

We’re looking for someone with:

 - 8+ years of experience in product partnerships, strategic partnerships, or business development within the technology or digital ecosystem.

 - Proven experience driving growth and distribution partnerships in India.

 - Demonstrated ability to initiate and scale partnerships that unlock measurable growth and adoption.

 - Strong experience negotiating and structuring complex agreements that span product integration, commercial strategy, and joint go-to-market efforts.

 - Deep understanding of India market dynamics and the ability to tailor partnership strategies to local contexts.

 - Excellent stakeholder management skills with the ability to collaborate cross-functionally and influence at senior levels.

 - A self-directed, highly adaptable mindset with comfort operating in fast-changing and ambiguous environments.

 - Strong communication skills and a collaborative, solutions-oriented approach.
